                     SavaPage NFC Service on Raspberry Pi
                    
                    
                               _______________      

                                Prerequisites


(1) Use Raspbian as OS.


(2) Make sure the Pi has a static IP address.

    A how-to to for assigning a static address can be found at:
    
    http://www.penguintutor.com/news/raspberrypi/linux-static
        

(3) Install dependent packages.
    
    $ sudo apt-get install libccid libacsccid1 pcscd

    - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
    According to the README of the libacsccid1 package the following readers 
    are supported: 
          
    ACR38U-CCID
    ACR3801
    ACR83U
    ACR85 PINPad Reader
    ACR88U
    ACR100-CCID
    ACR100 ICC Reader
    ACR101 ICC Reader
    ACR102 ICC Reader
    ACR122U
    ACR122T
    ACR122U-SAM
    ACR1222 Dual Reader
    ACR1222 1SAM Dual Reader
    ACR1222L 3S CL Reader
    ACR125 nPA plus
    ACR128U
    ACR1281 CL Reader (qPBOC)
    ACR1281 Dual Reader (qPBOC)
    ACR1281 PICC Reader (BSI)
    ACR1281 Dual Reader (BSI)
    APG8201

    - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
    Readers tested:
    
    ACS ACR122U-A2
    ACS ACR122U-A9
            

(4) Disable pn533 and nfc drivers in Raspbian kernel

    When an ACS Reader (ACR122U) plugs in, the Raspbian kernel(>3.5) will
    automatically load the pn533 driver. However, with the pn533 driver, 
    pcscd will report a "Can't claim interface" error. Therefore the pn533 
    and nfc driver should be disabled in the kernel.

    Edit the /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf file like this:
     
    $ sudo vi /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf
    
    .. and make sure that the file contains the following 2 lines:
    
    install nfc /bin/false
    install pn533 /bin/false


(5) Reboot the Raspberry Pi

    $ sudo reboot
    

(6) Connect ACS USB NFC Reader and the speakers.

                                   Install


(1) Create directory for the SavaPage files.
     
    $ sudo mkdir /usr/local/bin/savapage
        
        
(2) Copy files from SavaPage Server.

    $ sudo scp you@server:/home/savapage/providers/nfc/linux-armv6/* /usr/local/bin/savapage/


(3) Create savapage-nfc-reader.ini from the template and edit the settings.

    $ cd /usr/local/bin/savapage
    $ sudo cp savapage-nfc-reader.ini.template savapage-nfc-reader.ini
    $ sudo vi savapage-nfc-reader.ini

    Change the IP address and check the port of the SavaPage Server. You can 
    change the default port of the network reader service as well.

    Sample sound files are present. You can use the sample script files for your
    own customization: for example to communicate with the PiFace Control & Display.         

    NOTE: Check that your firewall is open for the IP address and ports set 
          in the .ini file.
          
    
(4) Install the service.
         
    $ sudo /usr/local/bin/savapage/install


(5) Swipe a card.

    A sound must be heard through the speaker(s).             
    
    
(6) Reboot.
 
    $ sudo reboot        

        
(7) Check if the service is started by swiping a card.

    A sound must be heard through the speaker(s).

                               Troubleshooting


(1) Inspect syslog entries.
                                
    $ cat /var/log/syslog | grep savapage-nfc-reader


(2) Use telnet from the SavaPage server to check if the Network Card Reader can 
    be reached. Telnet should echo 'savapage-nfc-reader' and close immediately. 
    
    As an example for Raspberry Pi 192.168.1.200:7772 ... 
    
    $ telnet 192.168.1.200 7772
    
    Trying 192.168.1.200...
    Connected to 192.168.1.200.
    Escape character is '^]'.
    savapage-nfc-readerConnection closed by foreign host.


(3) Execute pcsc_scan to scan PC/SC readers connected to the host

    pcsc_scan is part of pcsc-tools package

    $ sudo apt-get install pcsc-tools


                               _______________

                                  Uninstall


(1) Uninstall the service.
         
    $ sudo /usr/local/bin/savapage/uninstall


(2) Remove SavaPage directory.

    $ sudo rm -rf /usr/local/bin/savapage
