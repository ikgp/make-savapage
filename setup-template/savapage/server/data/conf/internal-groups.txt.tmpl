#                       THIS IS A TEMPLATE FILE 
#
# Copy this file to "internal-groups.txt" and add groups as explained below.
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# This file defines custom groups with existing users as members. The groups 
# are available in the application in addition to the groups provided by the  
# selected external user source. This is useful in the following situations:
#
#   * You have configured the system to import users from a source that does 
#     not support groups.
#
#   * You do not have permission to create new groups in the user source.
#
#   * You'd like to create small groups just for use within SavaPage and it's
#     not appropriate to great a new group in the user source.
#
# Groups defined in this file can be added to the application just like any 
# user source group.
#
# Groups defined in this file should have a name distinctive to any groups
# defined in your external user source. If the group names clash, this file 
# takes precedence.
#
# The format of the lines in this file is as follows:
#
#   GroupA: username1
#   GroupA: username2
#   GroupB: username1
#
# ... meaning <group> has a member <username>.
#
# In this case, username1 is a  member of both GroupA and GroupB, while 
# username2 is a member only of GroupA. Users may be a member of multiple 
# groups by repeating the username in subsequent lines with different groups.
#
# The <group> and <username> may be separated by one of these characters: 
# : (semicolon), = (equals), or TAB.
# 
# END-OF-COMMENT: Add group definitions below this line.
