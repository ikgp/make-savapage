#
# Copy this file to "username-aliases.txt" and add aliases as explained below.
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# This file defines a list of username aliases. An alias maps a username 
# from one format to another. This is useful when:
#
#   * You want to provide a way for users to log into the system with a username
#     formatted in a different way.
#
#   * You want to assign print jobs arriving under the alias name to another 
#     username. 
#
# The format of the alias file is as follows:
#
#   aliasname1: username1
#   aliasnameA: username2
#   aliasnameB: username2
#
# ... meaning <aliasname> maps to <username> in the application database.
# 
# A user may have multiple aliases. In this example, username2 is known as both
# aliasnameA and aliasnameB.
#
# The <aliasname> and <username> may be separated by one of these characters: 
# : (semicolon), = (equals), or TAB.
# 
# END-OF-COMMENT: Add aliases below this line.
